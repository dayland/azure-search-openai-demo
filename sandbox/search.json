To achieve the maximum benefits from our capability investments, the ADF force structure must become not only focused, but also integrated.\n8.6 The current joint force, namely the combined effect of Navy, Army and Air Force working together, does not appropriately reflect the growth of domains. The evolution to five domains – maritime, land, air, space and cyber – demands a new approach.\n8.7 The ADF must rapidly evolve into a genuine Integrated Force, which harnesses effects across all of the five domains. The Integrated Force must be optimised for National Defence.\n8.8 In effecting our strategy of denial in Australia’s northern approaches, the ADF’s operational success will depend on the ability of the Integrated Force to apply the following critical capabilities:\nundersea warfare capabilities (crewed and uncrewed) optimised for persistent, long-range sub-surface intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and strike;\nan enhanced, integrated targeting capability;\nan enhanced long-range strike capability in all domains;\na fully enabled, integrated amphibious-capable combined-arms land system;\nenhanced, all-domain, maritime capabilities for sea denial operations and localised sea control;\n",
